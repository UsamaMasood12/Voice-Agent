Database Schemas - RoomiAI MongoDB Document Structures

This file defines the MongoDB document structures/schemas for all collections including
rooms, room_types, guests, bookings, payments, service_requests, and call_logs. While
MongoDB is schemaless, these schemas serve as documentation and can be used to create
indexes and validate document structure during insert/update operations.
