Booking Service - Business Logic for Reservation Operations

This file contains the core booking logic including reservation creation, modification,
cancellation, and confirmation number generation. It validates dates, checks availability,
calculates total pricing with taxes, handles payment processing, and sends confirmation
emails. This is the central service that orchestrates the entire booking workflow.
