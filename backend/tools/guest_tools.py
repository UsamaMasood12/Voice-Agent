Guest Tools - AI Agent Function Calling for Guest Operations

This file defines callable functions for managing guest information during conversations.
Functions include: find_guest(), create_guest(), update_guest_preferences(), and get_guest_history().
When the agent collects guest details (name, phone, email), these tools save the data to
the database and can retrieve returning guest profiles to personalize the experience.
